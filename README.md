# Pandas and NumPy Operations

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates data manipulation and numerical operations using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. 
The script is designed for performing common data analysis tasks such as data cleaning, aggregation, and numerical computations on **'T3minidata.csv'** dataset.
**'T3minidata.csv'** Dataset contains various components of weather on each day for the period of eight years (i.e from 2010 to 2018)

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load CSV or Excel files for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, filter rows and columns, and reformat data.
- **Aggregation**: Perform group-by operations, summaries, and statistical analyses.
- **Numerical Operations**: Utilize NumPy for vectorized operations and matrix manipulations.
- **Visualization**: (Optional) Extend the script to include data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
